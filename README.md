This repository contains examples of commands to be sent to the personalization device provided by TrustInnov allowing the ICAO 9303 encoding of an Javacard smartcard.
These examples are here to demonstrate how easy it is to integrate with the innovative personalization device.

Some real use-cases:
 - electronic encoding of an eID card, ePassport, laissez-passer, emergency document, witness protection passport, driving license, bio. resident permit, voting...
 - electronic encoding of a biometrical access control cards, military cards, police cards, airport staff cards, seafarer ID cards...

To be able to test those examples, you need to order a demo kit.
